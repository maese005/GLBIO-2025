* fusion_ai_cancer.py: Multimodal Cancer Outcome Prediction with Deep Learning

This script integrates **clinical, imaging, and genomic data** to predict cancer treatment outcomes using a **deep learning model with an early fusion approach**. It includes **data preprocessing (standardization, one-hot encoding, missing value handling)**, builds a **neural network for survival prediction**, and applies **SHAP explainability techniques** to interpret feature importance. This implementation replicates key aspects of **multimodal AI pipelines** used in precision oncology research. 
* fusion_ai_cancer_missingness.py:
This script introduces missingness.

* transformer_based_late_fusion_for_multimodal_precision_medicine.py
This script implements a transformer-like approach with late fusion for precision medicine.
